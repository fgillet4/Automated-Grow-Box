# Automated-Grow-Box
The following libaries are required to run this code
Arduino: DHT11 sensor library is required.

Python: 
pip3 install pyserial, numpy, pyplot, and csv

The code will first de displayed on the arduino serial monitor and then read to python using a USB and interpreted by pyserial.
NOTE: Change 'COM3' to the specific serial port for your arduino using the Arduino IDE. Note that both the serial monitor and python cannot be runnning at the same time.
Furthur developments in this code will be database managing for data aquired during subsequent grows.
